# UWP_with_nLog
This project should show a minimum reproducible scenario for UWP crash, that uses nLog as a logger.

# Console_with_nLog
This is a console app, that works just fine with the same set of configurations.

# How to crash
Try to run UWP_with_nLog project several times. 10 times should be enough (or ask your colleagues, I've noticed, that this crash is possible not on all devices). At some point you will get this random crash:
![crash](img/crash.JPG?raw=true)
